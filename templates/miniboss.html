  In Hollow Knight, minibosses occupy a unique space between standard enemies
  and full-fledged bosses, offering one-time, challenging encounters without the
  grandeur of a boss title card. These foes test players' combat reflexes and
  reward them with access to deeper regions or narrative beats, often appearing
  in areas tied to the game’s larger themes of decay, duty, or forgotten valor.
  Though the game doesn’t always formally label them as "minibosses," certain
  enemies stand out for their difficulty and importance, both in battle and
  worldbuilding.

  Some notable examples include the Great Husk Sentries in the Watcher’s
  Spire—armored remnants of Hallownest's past who defend the path to Lurien with
  unyielding ferocity. Others, like unique versions of Durandoos or Heavy
  Sentries, appear only once and are tougher than their common counterparts.
  Even the elusive Aluba, found in the Ancient Basin, offers a surprise twist by
  vanishing forever after a single hit—less a fight, more a curiosity, but still
  notable in the game’s ecosystem. These minibosses, while easy to overlook,
  flesh out the world’s atmosphere and elevate tension in unexpected corners of
  Hallownest.

  The Gruz Mother in Hollow Knight is a bloated, buzzing creature that was once
  a peaceful part of the Forgotten Crossroads. However, like many other beings
  in Hallownest, it has been corrupted by the Infection, transforming into an
  aggressive and mindless beast. Though its appearance suggests motherhood,
  there is little left of its nurturing instincts—its movements are erratic, and
  its final moments are unsettling, as it bursts open to reveal a swarm of
  smaller Gruzzers. This tragic fate reflects how the Infection twists even the
  most basic instincts, turning creatures into mere husks of their former
  selves.

  Gruz Mother resides in a chamber within the Forgotten Crossroads, one of the
  earliest areas the Knight explores. It is found in a small, enclosed space
  that blocks the way forward, forcing players to fight it before they can
  continue exploring the area. The environment around it is littered with broken
  shells and remnants of smaller Gruzzers, hinting at its past role in their
  protection. The room itself is simple, with minimal hazards, allowing players
  to focus solely on dodging and reacting to the creature’s erratic movements.

  When the fight begins, Gruz Mother attacks by bouncing chaotically across the
  room, ricocheting off the walls and floor. While its movements may seem
  random, they follow a loose pattern that allows observant players to predict
  where it will land. It lacks any direct offensive moves, relying entirely on
  its unpredictable mobility to deal damage. Once defeated, it explodes,
  releasing eight Gruzzers, which are small enemies that quickly skitter around
  the battlefield. Though individually weak, they can catch players off guard if
  not dealt with swiftly.

<p class="text-start p-2">
  Defeating Gruz Mother grants access to a passage further into the Forgotten
  Crossroads, opening the way to deeper parts of Hallownest such as Blue Lake,
  Sly and Salubra. However, it does not drop any Geo or items, making it a
  purely progression-based fight. The true challenge lies in learning to
  navigate its unpredictable movements early in the game, helping players
  sharpen their reflexes before facing more dangerous enemies ahead.

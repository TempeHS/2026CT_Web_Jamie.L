  The False Knight is a tragic figure in Hollow Knight, a maggot who stole the
  armor of Hegemol, one of Hallownest’s Five Great Knights. His intentions were
  noble—he sought strength to protect his weaker siblings—but the Infection
  twisted his mind, turning him into a deluded brute. Despite his imposing
  appearance, he is not a true warrior, merely a desperate creature clinging to
  borrowed power. His story is one of misplaced ambition, a creature who wanted
  to protect but instead became a threat. The armor he wears is far too large
  for him, a symbol of his stolen strength and the burden he cannot truly bear.
  His fate is a reminder that power without understanding can lead to ruin, and
  his downfall is inevitable as he succumbs to the very forces he sought to
  resist.

<p class="text-start p-2">
  You’ll encounter the False Knight in the Forgotten Crossroads, inside a large
  chamber beneath the storeroom where his maggot siblings reside. The area is
  filled with broken remnants of Hallownest’s past, a fitting stage for a
  creature who clings to a legacy that is not his own. As you enter, he
  dramatically crashes through the ceiling, crushing nearby enemies before
  turning his aggression toward you. The fight is framed as a grand battle, but
  in truth, it is a desperate struggle from a creature who has convinced himself
  he is something greater. The Forgotten Crossroads itself is a place of decay,
  its once-thriving pathways now filled with infected creatures and crumbling
  structures. The False Knight stands as a guardian of nothing, a relic of a
  kingdom that has long since fallen into ruin.

  The False Knight wields a massive mace, using it to unleash devastating slam
  attacks that send shockwaves across the ground. To avoid these, you must jump
  over the shockwaves at the right moment, timing your movements carefully to
  avoid taking damage. He also performs leaping strikes, targeting your last
  position—so moving quickly is key. His attacks are slow but powerful, each one
  carrying the weight of his desperation. After enough damage, his armor cracks
  open, revealing his vulnerable maggot form. During this phase, he throws a
  tantrum, causing debris to fall from the ceiling, which you can knock back at
  him for extra damage. This moment is telling—his rage is not that of a warrior
  but of a frightened creature who has lost control. His movements become
  erratic, his attacks more reckless, and his downfall becomes inevitable.

  Defeating the False Knight unlocks access to a chest with 200 Geo and the City
  Crest, an essential item that unlocks the path to the City of Tears.
  Additionally, his defeat marks a turning point in the game, signaling the
  player's growing strength and ability to overcome larger foes. His battle is
  one of the first major encounters that teaches players how to read enemy
  movements, react to environmental hazards, and adapt to shifting attack
  patterns. Though he is not the most difficult boss, his presence looms large
  in the early game, making him a memorable challenge that sets the stage for
  even greater battles ahead.
